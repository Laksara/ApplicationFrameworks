<h2>LAB SHEET 2</h2>
<p>
    1. Understand the ‘this’ keyword in JavaScript.
    <ul>
    <li> Declare a variable named vehicleName in the window object (var) and assign value
        ‘Toyota’ to it. This a global variable declaration.</li>
    <li> Declare a function named printVehicleNameOuter to print out the vehicle name. (Use
        this.vehicleName, since the variable you declared in the above step is a global variable
        assigned to window object. In global scope this points to window object. In the browser
        scope global object is window object and all the global variable and function
        declarations are assigned to window object).</li>
    <li> Test this by printing this and window object to console. And verify that they
        both prints window object.</li>
    <li> Check the vehicleName and the printVehicleNameOuter you declared are in the
        printed window object.</li>
    <li> Call the function printVehicleNameOuter and verify it is printing ‘Toyota’.</li>
    <li> Declare an object named Vehicle (using object literal notation ‘{}’) which have a variable
        called vehicleName and assigned the value ‘Nissan’ to it. Declare a function named
        printVehicleNameInner and assign printVehicleNameOuter to it.</li>
    <li> Execute the printVehicleNameInner function and see the results.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    2. Understanding JavaScript closure.
    <ul>
    <li>Create a function named taxCalculator which accepts the tax percentage as an
        argument.</li>
    <li>taxCalculator should return another function which accepts the amount as an argument
        and returns calculated tax percentage (amount*taxPercentage/100).</li>
    <li>Call taxCalculator function and assigned the returned value to a variable.</li>
    <li>Now, call that variable (it is a function now) with different amounts and get tax value
        calculated.</li>
    <li>Notice how you have encapsulated the tax percentage and calculation from consumers.
        Now consumers can calculate the tax percentage without the knowledge of tax
        percentage and calculation.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    3. Write a function to call GitHub API (https://api.github.com/users) and get users.
    <ul>
    <li>Try to understand the functionality of Promises.</li>
    <li>Print all users to console.</li>
    <li>Try to return fetched users and print it in the caller.</li>
    </ul>
    Notice the asynchronous execution of the JavaScript and how it is resolved using promises.
</p>
<p>
    4. Classes in JavaScript
    <ul>
    <li>Create a class named Vehicle using a function.
    <li>Add property named type to the class (this.type). Assign a value to that variable using a
    constructor argument.</li>
    <li>Add a function to its prototype named drive (Vehicle.prototype.print...). Print ‘Vehicle is
    driving’ in the function body.</li>
    <li>Add VehicleCount (Vehicle.VehicleCount) as a static variable.</li>
    <li>Increase the number of VehicleCount (Vehicle.VehicleCount++) by one inside the
    constructor.</li>
    <li>Create an object from Vehicle class (new Vehicle) and check static variable value, type
    property value and function works.</li>
    <li>Create a class named Car and extend the class Vehicle (Car.prototype =
    Object.create(Vehicle.prototype); Car.prototype.constructor = Car).
    <li>Add a new method called balanceWheels to Car and print ‘Wheels are balanced’ in the
    function body.</li>
    <li>Call balanceWheels and drive methods using a car object and verify the functionality.</li>
    <li>Check the static variable value and type variable value. Notice that they are not correct.</li>
    <li>The reason for the above behavior is that we didn’t call the parent constructor from the
    child class. Do this by using the call method (in Car constructor function Vehicle.call(this,
    type);</li>
    <li>Re-validate the values.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    5. Declare variables using const and let keywords and observe the difference.
</p>
<p>
    6. Use arrow functions.
</p>
<p>
    7. Try exercise 3 with async/await.
</p>
<p>
    8. Try exercise 4 class, extends, get, set and super keywords
